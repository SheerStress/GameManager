# GameManager

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## Description

# Purpose

A mobile/desktop app designed for compatibility with a fictional fantasy MMO game. Players would be able to access most of their in-game data without needing to log into the game itself. This kind of functionality could be useful if, for example, someone wants to communicate with guild members at a time when they can't access the game software. Players can also use in-game currency to purchase items that will be accessible to them in the game once they can access it again. There are many online games that feature limited-time events, and being able to potentially purchase rare items no matter where you are could be a significant benefit to players who travel frequently. This app also provides basic account setting configuration options, which allow for username changes, password changes, and contact info changes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
